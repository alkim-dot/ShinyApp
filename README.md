# ShinyApp

I try to develop an R-shiny dashboard for one of the Ph.D. studies which is related to acoustic parameters and emotions. This interactive dashboard is used to listen to the vocalizations of people. You can change acoustic parameters and you can listen to 20 different people sounds for these different parameters by checking a specific number of every point. You can get a participant number from clicking points. After that, you can change parameters from the below part based on the graph and listen to the vocalizations of people.

# Future Steps

I want to hear to voices with clicking the points on the graph without usinig any other additional steps.
